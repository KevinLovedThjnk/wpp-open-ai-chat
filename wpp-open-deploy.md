## 📋 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **Build completed** ✅

- [ ] **API endpoints verified** (health check, AI assistant)
- [ ] **Authentication flow tested** (Open OS context)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Choose deployment method** (I recommend Option 1 for quick testing)
2. **Upload files to WPP Open staging**
3. **Test the AI functionality** from within the platform
4. **Verify Open OS integration** works correctly

## 🔍 What Will Work After Deployment

- ✅ **Open OS context detection** - Will detect you're in the platform
- ✅ **Automatic authentication** - Will get user token from Open OS
- ✅ **AI API calls** - Will work without CORS issues
- ✅ **Real AI responses** - Will connect to actual WPP Open AI services

## 🚨 Current Status

**Local development**: ❌ CORS blocked (expected)
**WPP Open staging**: 🚀 Ready to deploy and test!
